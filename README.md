# Department of ICT, BUP

## How to setup?
```
i) create your virtual environment with python3+
ii) active your virtual environment
iii) pip install -r requirements.txt
iv) ./manage.py migrate
v) ./manage.py runserver
```
That's It.

### I have less time to develop it. Couldn't make it that much cool yet.
### So what are the features we can make together:
```
i) create meaningful content for all pages
ii) create responsive ui
iii) create student registration and login process
iv) send email to students for informing any events news etc.
This list can extend more! please add.....
```

`If you have any feature/change request, then create a pr and let me know.
I will merge it and deploy it as well.`
